We evaluated the operating time, blood transfusion, postoperative irrigation period, and catheter-removal time. Patients were assessed at baseline and during the follow-up using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax). <BR><BR>Results: The mean operation time for PKVP (40.3 ± 15 minutes) was significantly shorter than that of TURP (55 ± 11.1 minutes) (P < 0.001). The postoperative irrigation period was significantly shorter in the PKVP group (mean 6 ± 3 hours) than in the TURP group (mean 20 ± 8 hours) (P < 0.001). The mean catheter-removal time was significantly later after TURP (68 ± 21 hours) than after PKVP (35 ± 9 hours) (P < 0.001). The groups had comparable mean IPSS and Qmax values at baseline, and both had significant improvement in these parameters after operation. For IPSS, especially at the third month after the operation, PKVP patients showed significantly greater improvement (P < 0.001). There was no difference in Qmax values between the groups (P > 0.05). Whereas blood transfusion was necessary for two patients in the TURP group, there were no transfusions in the PKVP group. <BR><BR>Conclusions: Because of the short operating time, smaller blood loss, shorter period of irrigation and catheterization, use of isotonic fluid, and absence of electrical current, PKVP is safe and advantageous. Although these early results have shown that this technique may be a good alternative among the minimally invasive methods for the surgical management of BPH, further studies with longer-term results are essential.

We evaluated the operating time, blood transfusion, postoperative irrigation period, and catheter-removal time. Patients were assessed at baseline and during the follow-up using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax). <BR><BR>Results: The mean operation time for PKVP (40.3 ± 15 minutes) was significantly shorter than that of TURP (55 ± 11.1 minutes) (P < 0.001). The postoperative irrigation period was significantly shorter in the PKVP group (mean 6 ± 3 hours) than in the TURP group (mean 20 ± 8 hours) (P < 0.001). The mean catheter-removal time was significantly later after TURP (68 ± 21 hours) than after PKVP (35 ± 9 hours) (P < 0.001). The groups had comparable mean IPSS and Qmax values at baseline, and both had significant improvement in these parameters after operation. For IPSS, especially at the third month after the operation, PKVP patients showed significantly greater improvement (P < 0.001). There was no difference in Qmax values between the groups (P > 0.05). Whereas blood transfusion was necessary for two patients in the TURP group, there were no transfusions in the PKVP group. <BR><BR>Conclusions: Because of the short operating time, smaller blood loss, shorter period of irrigation and catheterization, use of isotonic fluid, and absence of electrical current, PKVP is safe and advantageous. Although these early results have shown that this technique may be a good alternative among the minimally invasive methods for the surgical management of BPH, further studies with longer-term results are essential.

We assessed the safety and efficacy<BR>of this technique with special attention to the thermal injury generated<BR>by this new device.<BR>Methods: 25 patients otherwise suitable for TURP ( mean age 68 [56<BR>– 84], IPSS 20.4 [11 – 31], QOL 4.4 [2 – 6], PSA 2.3 NG/L [0.1 –6],<BR>Qmax 8.1 ml/s [2.6 – 16.4] and residual volume (RV) 195.5 mls [0 –<BR>685]) underwent PKVP. In addition thermal injury by PKVP and TURP<BR>was assessed in 5 patients. Operating time (OR), catheter time (TC),<BR>hospital stay (HS) and possible complications were monitored. Follow<BR>up was carried out at 3 months.<BR>Results: Mean OR time was 43 min [17 – 87] with an average intraoperative<BR>fluid absorption of 0.86 L [-2.5 – 6]. None of the patients required<BR>to be transfused peri and post-operatively. One patient developed<BR>congestive cardiac failure due to intra-operative fluid absorption.<BR>TC was on average 27.5 Hrs [8 – 76] with a post-operative HS of 2<BR>days [1 – 4]. 2 Patients had secondary haemorrhages and one patient<BR>was re-operated due to persistent obstruction. The thermal injury generated<BR>with PKVP was 0.58 mm [0.2 – 1], whilst that generated with<BR>conventional TURP was 1.6 mm [0.1 – 3]. At 3 months there is improvement<BR>in their flow rates and symptoms (Qmax 21 ml/s [4.8 – 44],<BR>RV 65.7 [0 – 391], IPSS 6.1 [1 –21], QoL 1.6 [1 – 6]).<BR>Conclusion: Our results confirm that PKVP is a safe and efficient alternative<BR>to TURP.

This system permits rapid prostate tissue removal by endoscopic vaporization with little bleeding and no pad return using saline irrigation and therefore eliminating TURP syndrome.<BR><BR>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients (mean age 70; range 49-90 years) with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) without suspected cancer, confirmed by digital rectal examination and PSA tests, were treated between October 1998 and February 1999 with the Gyrus and evaluated at 1 and 3 months postoperatively by the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and maximum urinary flow rate.<BR><BR>RESULTS: No postoperative bleeding necessitating catheterization for postoperative retention occurred. The duration of the procedure was < or = 30 minutes in 12 patients, 30 to 60 minutes in 27 patients, and >60 minutes in 3 patients. The mean time of postoperative continuous bladder irrigation was 1.2 days (0.5-3 days). The mean catheterization time was 1.4 days (range 0.5-5 days). Urethral stricture requiring treatment occurred in two patients. Dysuria was reported by four patients (mild two, severe two). The postoperative hospitalization was a mean of 2.2 days. The mean peak flow rate increased from 7.9 to 19.7 mL/sec at 3 months, and the IPSS decreased from 16 to 9 at 3 months.<BR><BR>CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results with a bipolar electrode for electrovaporization of the prostate using the Gyrus suggest that it is a useful and safe endoscopic device. It appears to be an effective treatment for BPH; however, long-term results (i.e., 1-year follow-up) should be evaluated. This pilot series permits a comparative study with TURP to assess the benefits for patients and the health care system.",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11339400,

Whether the hybrid technique of bipolar resection and vaporization of the prostate further improves catheterization time, dysuria, and complication profiles has not been defined, however. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety profile of bipolar hybrid prostate surgery using both resection and vaporization modes, with bipolar resection undertaken using the transurethral resection in saline bipolar system. Patients and Methods: This was a randomized controlled trial that compared bipolar hybrid surgery and bipolar resection of the prostate among men aged_50 years with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) whose course of medical therapy had failed or who had recurrent urinary retention (CUHK_CCT00623). Patients were randomly assigned to receive either bipolar hybrid surgery or bipolar resection of the prostate. Both patients and assessors were blinded to the type of surgery performed. The primary study end point was catheter time. The secondary end points included postoperative hospital stay and dysuria score. We report the interim results for 86 patients. Results: Forty-six patients were in the hybrid group and 40 were in the resection group. There were no differences between the two groups in prostate volumes (61.5 cc, standard deviation [SD]=34.5 vs 61.0 cc, SD=23.8), preoperative prostate-specific antigen levels (8.7_ng/mL, SD=8.5 vs 9.5_ng/mL, SD=8.4), or preoperative retention status (56.5% vs 70%). The mean operative time was 46.2 minutes for the hybrid group (SD=20.2) and 39.2 minutes for the resection group (SD=17.5). The hybrid group had a significantly shorter postoperative catheter time (34.5_h, SD=15.8 vs 44.7_h, SD=24.5, P=0.027). There was a significant difference between the two groups in the postoperative pain score on day 1 postsurgery (3.5 in the hybrid group vs 1.0 in the resection group, P=0.028). There was no difference between the groups in terms of changes in serum hemoglobin and serum sodium levels or the reintervention rate. All patients voided well after operation, with maximal flow improvements of 9.9_mL/s (SD 8.1) and 8.2_mL/s (SD 10.0) for the hybrid and resection groups, respectively, 1 month postsurgery. Conclusion: Transurethral bipolar resection and vaporization of the prostate reduces catheterization time and facilitates postoperative care.",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21923418,

The study included 60 patients with BPH who were randomized in two groups (1:1 fashion). The mean age, International Prostate Symptom Score, serum prostate-specific antigen value, maximum urinary flow rate, residual urine, prostate size, operative time, blood loss, resected volume, catheterization time, hospital stay, and intraoperative and postoperative complications were compared in both groups, with a follow-up period of 6 months postoperatively.<BR>RESULTS:<BR><BR>Both techniques were comparable to each other.

In addition, the multiple surgeon setting and blinded clinical assessment conducted suggest minimal bias was introduced.","Abstract Background and Purpose: In comparison with monopolar transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), bipolar TURP has been shown to have similar efficacy and complication profiles. Whether the hybrid technique of bipolar resection and vaporization of the prostate further improves catheterization time, dysuria, and complication profiles has not been defined, however. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety profile of bipolar hybrid prostate surgery using both resection and vaporization modes, with bipolar resection undertaken using the transurethral resection in saline bipolar system. Patients and Methods: This was a randomized controlled trial that compared bipolar hybrid surgery and bipolar resection of the prostate among men aged_50 years with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) whose course of medical therapy had failed or who had recurrent urinary retention (CUHK_CCT00623). Patients were randomly assigned to receive either bipolar hybrid surgery or bipolar resection of the prostate. Both patients and assessors were blinded to the type of surgery performed. The primary study end point was catheter time. The secondary end points included postoperative hospital stay and dysuria score. We report the interim results for 86 patients. Results: Forty-six patients were in the hybrid group and 40 were in the resection group. There were no differences between the two groups in prostate volumes (61.5 cc, standard deviation [SD]=34.5 vs 61.0 cc, SD=23.8), preoperative prostate-specific antigen levels (8.7_ng/mL, SD=8.5 vs 9.5_ng/mL, SD=8.4), or preoperative retention status (56.5% vs 70%). The mean operative time was 46.2 minutes for the hybrid group (SD=20.2) and 39.2 minutes for the resection group (SD=17.5). The hybrid group had a significantly shorter postoperative catheter time (34.5_h, SD=15.8 vs 44.7_h, SD=24.5, P=0.027). There was a significant difference between the two groups in the postoperative pain score on day 1 postsurgery (3.5 in the hybrid group vs 1.0 in the resection group, P=0.028). There was no difference between the groups in terms of changes in serum hemoglobin and serum sodium levels or the reintervention rate. All patients voided well after operation, with maximal flow improvements of 9.9_mL/s (SD 8.1) and 8.2_mL/s (SD 10.0) for the hybrid and resection groups, respectively, 1 month postsurgery. Conclusion: Transurethral bipolar resection and vaporization of the prostate reduces catheterization time and facilitates postoperative care.",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21923418,

We investigated whether the histologic diagnosis and specimen preservation<BR>were impacted using the GYRUS system.<BR>Patients/ Methods: Thirteen patients with bladder tumors were treated with<BR>standard TURBT (8) or GYRUS (5). Each histologic specimen was reviewed<BR>by a single pathologist, who was blinded to the treatment. The depth of thermal<BR>artifact, amount of thermal damage, preservation of specimen, and affect<BR>on diagnosis were assessed. Thermal artifact was measured in millimeters<BR>from the edge of the specimen until normal tissue was seen. Thermal<BR>damage was graded as: 1 5 none; 2 5 ,25% of tissue damaged (minimal);<BR>3 5 25% to 80% of tissue damaged (moderate); 4 5 . 80% of the tissue<BR>damaged (extensive). Specimen preservation was graded from 1 (poor) to 4<BR>(excellent).

Bipolar lack of detrusor stimulation & Minimal blood loss.,"Background and Purpose: Bipolar electrocautery has recently been introduced as a modality for transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURBT). The primary benefits of bipolar TURBT stem from the use of saline irrigant rather than glycine or water. TURBT should be conducted in a fashion such that the resected tissue can be used for proper grading and staging, so excessive cauterization of the tissue should be avoided. In this study, we compared the pathologic characteristics of bladder tumor specimens resected with bipolar versus standard monopolar energy to determine specimen quality.<BR><BR>Patients and Methods: Bipolar TURBT (Gyrus Medical Inc., Maple Grove, MN) was performed in 11 patients. Pathologic specimens were compared with the specimens from 11 patients who had previously undergone standard monopolar TURBT. Resected tissue was examined by a pathologist who recorded tumor size, grade, location, presence of muscularis propria, presence of muscle invasion, and final diagnosis. The pathologist also determined the degree of cautery artifact in each specimen. The pathologist was blinded to the form of electrocautery used and the clinical diagnosis.<BR><BR>Results: Transurethral resection with bipolar electrocautery was carried out without difficulty or complication in all cases. Similarly, there were no complications in resection by standard monopolar electrocautery. The bladder tumor chips obtained with bipolar TURBT were smaller because of the smaller size of the bipolar loop. However, this did not interfere with the pathologic assessment. There were no significant pathologic differences between specimens according to the type of cautery used. A large degree of cautery artifact was noted in the tissue of larger tumors resected using both monopolar and bipolar electrocautery. However, the incidence and degree of cautery artifact were similar in the two groups. No trends between tumor location and degree of cautery effect were noted. The pathologist had no difficulty reaching a full and proper diagnosis in all cases involving either form of electrocautery.<BR><BR>Conclusions: Bipolar electrocautery is well suited for TURBT.

In all, 18 consecutive patients had standard and 25 had bipolar TURP.<BR>RESULTS<BR>The resection was 18 g for standard and 15 g for the Gyrus TURP (part of the Gyrus chips are vaporized during resection). The Foley catheter was removed sooner (1.8 vs 3.2 days) and the hospital stay was less in the Gyrus group (1.2 vs 2.1 days). Acute complications occurred in a third of the standard group and four (16%) of the Gyrus group. Long-term complications were comparable, at two each in the standard and Gyrus groups. Four patients (15%) with small glands went home on the day of surgery, needing no bladder irrigation after Gyrus TURP.<BR>CONCLUSION<BR>Few innovations in TURP technique have been described in the past few decades but comparing Gyrus to standard TURP showed that the former allows earlier removal of the urinary catheter and earlier discharge from hospital, while decreasing complications. The Gyrus system also has other benefits; it allows coagulation of tissue during resection, resulting in excellent intraoperative visualization, and normal saline is used as the irrigant fluid, reducing the potential for TUR syndrome. The shorter stay after Gyrus TURP can result in cost savings of up to $1200/patient/day at our institution.",http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2005.05253.x/abstract,

Diagnostic work-up and indications for TURP should follow the European Association of Urology benign prostatic hyperplasia guidelines. Pressure flow studies are not indicated as a routine diagnostic procedure but are highly recommended under certain conditions (eg, unsuccessful TURP, young age, previous pelvic surgery). Various technical improvements such as video-TURP, continuous-flow instruments, and bipolar TURP have substantially decreased the mortality and morbidity of TURP today. In the bipolar transurethral resection era, bleeding remains the most significant intra- and perioperative complication. The short-term and, particularly, long-term efficacy of TURP is unsurpassed, as documented by substantial improvements in symptoms, maximum flow rate, and postvoid residual volume. The retreatment rate of TURP is in the range of 8–12% within a decade after primary surgery, a value reached by many minimally invasive procedures as early as within 1–2 yr.

Materials and Methods: A total of 117 men were enrolled in this study. Fifty-eight patients underwent Gyrus Plasmasect TURP and 59 patients underwent monopolar TURP. They were followed up for 3 months after surgery. Results: Significant improvements were seen postoperatively in both the Gyrus and monopolar groups in terms of prostatic volume, International Prostate Symptom Score, quality of life score, peak flow rate, and post-void residual urine volume. However, the degree of improvement was not statistically different between the 2 groups. Significantly less blood loss, shorter postoperative catheterization time and length of hospital stay were seen in the Gyrus group. Conclusions: Gyrus Plasmasect TURP yielded comparable results to monopolar TURP; however, this is only a preliminary study and follow-up is necessary to assess its long-term efficacy.",http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&file=UIN2004073003258,

Median resection time = 70 minutes.  No need to hurry through procedure whereby enabling training opportunities.,"Background and Purpose: With the improvement of medical therapy and minimally invasive surgical treatments for benign prostatic hyperplasia, the number of transurethral resections of the prostate (TURPs) done in training is decreasing. With fewer TURPs being performed, proficiency in this basic urologic technique has decreased, causing longer resection times. This often leads to a higher risk of fluid absorption, water toxicity, and hyponatremia (TUR syndrome). We examined the safety of bipolar electrocautery TURP (saline TURP) with the Gyrus PlasmaKinetic system using normal saline as irrigant. <BR><BR>Patients and Methods: Twenty-one men aged 54 to 85 years (median 70.0 years) underwent saline Plasma- Kinetic TURP from June 2002 to August 2003. Serum sodium, chloride, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were measured 1 hour prior to and 1 hour after TURP. Resection time, tissue weights, hospital stay, and catheter time were recorded and analyzed. <BR><BR>Results: The median preresection and postresection sodium concentrations were 139.0 mEq/mL and 140.0 mEq/L, respectively (ranges 130–142 mEq/L and 134–143 mEq/L). The corresponding chloride values were 106.5 mEq/L and 109.0 mEq/L (ranges 102–114 mEq/L and 106–116 mEq/L), and the hemoglobin and hematocrit values were 13.4 g/dL and 40.1 g/dL (8.7–15.2 g/dL and 33.7–46.7 g/dL) and 12.0 g/dL and 36.6 g/dL (8.2–14.4 g/dL and 27.5–43.7 g/dL), respectively. The median resection time was 65 minutes (range 45–140 minutes), and the median resected tissue weight was 20 g (range 5–61 g). There was no statistically significant difference between the preresection and postresection sodium concentrations, and no patient exhibited any clinical sign of TUR syndrome. <BR><BR>Conclusion: Gyrus PlasmaKinetic TURP using normal saline as the irrigant is a safe alternative to and is technically no different from traditional monopolar TURP. The system also provides the longer time needed to train urology residents without compromising patient safety. ",http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/end.2006.20.683?journalCode=end,

Maximum absorption by the breath-ethanol reading was compared with the serum concentration of absorbed glycine (analysed by anion-exchange chromatography).<BR>RESULTS<BR>Complete data on 120 men were assessed; 75% of the men absorbed irrigation fluid, with glycine levels above the normal range. The sodium levels tended to decrease with increasing glycine levels (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, __0.57; 120 men) and five men (4%) developed clinical features of the TUR syndrome. There was a weak correlation between breath-ethanol levels and serum glycine levels (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, 0.54). The experience of the surgeon, the weight of the resected chips, and the operative duration were not significantly predictive of irrigation fluid absorption.<BR>CONCLUSIONS<BR>A rising breath-ethanol level indicates irrigation fluid absorption.
