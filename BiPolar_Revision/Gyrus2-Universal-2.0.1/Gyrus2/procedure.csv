The plasmapocket provides excellent hemostasis with controlled energy.

The procedure is performedthrough a dedicated continuous flow resectoscope using saline irrigation.The prostate is gradually vaporized using antegrade or combinedantegrade and retrograde passes with the Plasma-V electrode. Subsequently,Plasmakinetic transurethral vaporesection of the prostate isdemonstrated using the same instruments and irrigation. The resectiontechnique is similar to standard TURP with key differences being emphasized.Finally, the technique of Plasmakinetic transurethral resectionof bladder tumor is shown.Results: We have used the Plasmakinetic system to perform over 30transurethral procedures. Prosate vaporization and resection is done ina saline environment with excellent hemostasis. The need for post-TURP irrigation of the bladder is rare and the catheter time is generallyless than 24 hours. In the bladder, the Plasmakinetic system providescontrolled energy allowing for safe resection along the lateral wallof the bladder and ureteral orfices. The plasma pocket provides excellenthemostasis with limited thermal effect allowing for deep and preciseresection of the bladder.Conclusions: Plasmakinetic vaporization and vaporesection of prostateand bladder tissue is an exciting new technology which makes the familiartechniques of TURP and bladder tumor resection even more efficientand safe.",http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/08927790152686901,

We evaluated the operating time, blood transfusion, postoperative irrigation period, and catheter-removal time. Patients were assessed at baseline and during the follow-up using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax). Results: The mean operation time for PKVP (40.3 ± 15 minutes) was significantly shorter than that of TURP (55 ± 11.1 minutes) (P < 0.001). The postoperative irrigation period was significantly shorter in the PKVP group (mean 6 ± 3 hours) than in the TURP group (mean 20 ± 8 hours) (P < 0.001). The mean catheter-removal time was significantly later after TURP (68 ± 21 hours) than after PKVP (35 ± 9 hours) (P < 0.001). The groups had comparable mean IPSS and Qmax values at baseline, and both had significant improvement in these parameters after operation. For IPSS, especially at the third month after the operation, PKVP patients showed significantly greater improvement (P < 0.001). There was no difference in Qmax values between the groups (P > 0.05). Whereas blood transfusion was necessary for two patients in the TURP group, there were no transfusions in the PKVP group. Conclusions: Because of the short operating time, smaller blood loss, shorter period of irrigation and catheterization, use of isotonic fluid, and absence of electrical current, PKVP is safe and advantageous. Although these early results have shown that this technique may be a good alternative among the minimally invasive methods for the surgical management of BPH, further studies with longer-term results are essential.

Day CaseTURP has been described but has not been widely adopted largely becauseof unpredictable peri-operative bleeding. The Gyrus plasma kinetic(PK)bipolar system works in a saline environment and has superior haemostaticeffect to monoplar diathermy.This paper reports 150 patients undergoingDay Case PK vaporisation (V) of prostate with a maximum followupof 2 years.PATIENTS & METHODS.150 ASA 1&2 men age 65–83 with proven bladder outflow obstructionunderwent PKV prostate on a day case basis. They were discharged homewith a catheter in situ (mean time to discharge 5.6 hours) and returned forcatheter removal at 48 hours. Mean prostate volume was 35mls (15–120).Patients were monitored haematologically and biochemically perioperativelyand at 48 hours. Analgesic requirements were recorded together with patientsatisfaction at 48 hours. Return to normal was recorded individuallyand subjectively by each patient. Follow up was undertaken at 2 months andat three month intervals thereafter recording satisfaction, IPSS, QoL andFlow rate and post void residual.RESULTS143 men were discharged on day one There were no readmissions. 150voided at first catheter removal at 48 hours. There were no electrolyte disturbancesand mean fall in Hb was 0.4 g/dl.There was no blood transfusionofr delayed bleeding. Analgesic requirements were minimal. Return to normalityvaried from 2 to 23 days (mean 8) with 18% of patients experiencingsome irritation to 15 days. Satisfaction rates were 95% and improvementin IPSS, QoL, FR and PVR were maintained to two years.DISCUSSIONPKVP offers immediate,effective relief of obstruction with high satisfactionand safety making it an ideal Day Case operation which could bewidely adopted.",http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/089277902320436558,

We evaluated the operating time, blood transfusion, postoperative irrigation period, and catheter-removal time. Patients were assessed at baseline and during the follow-up using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax). Results: The mean operation time for PKVP (40.3 ± 15 minutes) was significantly shorter than that of TURP (55 ± 11.1 minutes) (P < 0.001). The postoperative irrigation period was significantly shorter in the PKVP group (mean 6 ± 3 hours) than in the TURP group (mean 20 ± 8 hours) (P < 0.001). The mean catheter-removal time was significantly later after TURP (68 ± 21 hours) than after PKVP (35 ± 9 hours) (P < 0.001). The groups had comparable mean IPSS and Qmax values at baseline, and both had significant improvement in these parameters after operation. For IPSS, especially at the third month after the operation, PKVP patients showed significantly greater improvement (P < 0.001). There was no difference in Qmax values between the groups (P > 0.05). Whereas blood transfusion was necessary for two patients in the TURP group, there were no transfusions in the PKVP group. Conclusions: Because of the short operating time, smaller blood loss, shorter period of irrigation and catheterization, use of isotonic fluid, and absence of electrical current, PKVP is safe and advantageous. Although these early results have shown that this technique may be a good alternative among the minimally invasive methods for the surgical management of BPH, further studies with longer-term results are essential.

In addition thermal injury by PKVP and TURPwas assessed in 5 patients. Operating time (OR), catheter time (TC),hospital stay (HS) and possible complications were monitored. Followup was carried out at 3 months.Results: Mean OR time was 43 min [17 – 87] with an average intraoperativefluid absorption of 0.86 L [-2.5 – 6]. None of the patients requiredto be transfused peri and post-operatively. One patient developedcongestive cardiac failure due to intra-operative fluid absorption.TC was on average 27.5 Hrs [8 – 76] with a post-operative HS of 2days [1 – 4]. 2 Patients had secondary haemorrhages and one patientwas re-operated due to persistent obstruction. The thermal injury generatedwith PKVP was 0.58 mm [0.2 – 1], whilst that generated withconventional TURP was 1.6 mm [0.1 – 3]. At 3 months there is improvementin their flow rates and symptoms (Qmax 21 ml/s [4.8 – 44],RV 65.7 [0 – 391], IPSS 6.1 [1 –21], QoL 1.6 [1 – 6]).Conclusion: Our results confirm that PKVP is a safe and efficient alternativeto TURP. In addition the smaller thermal injury may offersafety advantages and perhaps a reduction in post-operative irritativesymptoms.",http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/08927790152686884,
PK TUVP (Not with PlasmaButton),Visibility,PK,Resection Loop / Other Electrode,Botto,PK,Electrovaporization of the Prostate with the Gyrus Device,"Journal of Endourology Vol. 15, Number 3, April 2001","Length of Stay = 2.2 days, Post-op catheterization = 1.4 days, vaporization nets good intraoperative vision, coag necrosis limited to 1mm = less swelling = less dysuria.","PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy and the safety of a new transurethral endoscopic device using bipolar electrocautery, the Gyrus system. This system permits rapid prostate tissue removal by endoscopic vaporization with little bleeding and no pad return using saline irrigation and therefore eliminating TURP syndrome.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients (mean age 70; range 49-90 years) with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) without suspected cancer, confirmed by digital rectal examination and PSA tests, were treated between October 1998 and February 1999 with the Gyrus and evaluated at 1 and 3 months postoperatively by the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and maximum urinary flow rate.RESULTS: No postoperative bleeding necessitating catheterization for postoperative retention occurred. The duration of the procedure was < or = 30 minutes in 12 patients, 30 to 60 minutes in 27 patients, and >60 minutes in 3 patients. The mean time of postoperative continuous bladder irrigation was 1.2 days (0.5-3 days). The mean catheterization time was 1.4 days (range 0.5-5 days). Urethral stricture requiring treatment occurred in two patients. Dysuria was reported by four patients (mild two, severe two). The postoperative hospitalization was a mean of 2.2 days. The mean peak flow rate increased from 7.9 to 19.7 mL/sec at 3 months, and the IPSS decreased from 16 to 9 at 3 months.CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results with a bipolar electrode for electrovaporization of the prostate using the Gyrus suggest that it is a useful and safe endoscopic device. It appears to be an effective treatment for BPH; however, long-term results (i.e., 1-year follow-up) should be evaluated. This pilot series permits a comparative study with TURP to assess the benefits for patients and the health care system.",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11339400,

The evolution of the bipolar transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) raised a question: Would it be able to provide all the advantages of HoLEP and compensate for all its drawbacks, including the higher costs and the steep learning curve?PATIENTS AND METHODS:A randomized study was performed that compared HoLEP with bipolar TURP. The study included 60 patients with BPH who were randomized in two groups (1:1 fashion). The mean age, International Prostate Symptom Score, serum prostate-specific antigen value, maximum urinary flow rate, residual urine, prostate size, operative time, blood loss, resected volume, catheterization time, hospital stay, and intraoperative and postoperative complications were compared in both groups, with a follow-up period of 6 months postoperatively.RESULTS:Both techniques were comparable to each other. They shared the same advantages of decreased perioperative morbidity. The longer operative time in the HoLEP group, however, was still statistically significant. In addition, the expense of performing HoLEP was nearly double that of bipolar TURP.CONCLUSION:HoLEP and bipolar TURP are effective in treating patients with lower urinary tract symptoms due to BPH, however; the long operative time, the steep learning curve, as well as the higher expenses of HoLEP are in favor of bipolar TURP.",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21745115,

Bipolar vs monopolar comparison for bladder tumors.  Bipolar lack of detrusor stimulation & Minimal blood loss.,"Background and Purpose: Bipolar electrocautery has recently been introduced as a modality for transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURBT). The primary benefits of bipolar TURBT stem from the use of saline irrigant rather than glycine or water. TURBT should be conducted in a fashion such that the resected tissue can be used for proper grading and staging, so excessive cauterization of the tissue should be avoided. In this study, we compared the pathologic characteristics of bladder tumor specimens resected with bipolar versus standard monopolar energy to determine specimen quality.Patients and Methods: Bipolar TURBT (Gyrus Medical Inc., Maple Grove, MN) was performed in 11 patients. Pathologic specimens were compared with the specimens from 11 patients who had previously undergone standard monopolar TURBT. Resected tissue was examined by a pathologist who recorded tumor size, grade, location, presence of muscularis propria, presence of muscle invasion, and final diagnosis. The pathologist also determined the degree of cautery artifact in each specimen. The pathologist was blinded to the form of electrocautery used and the clinical diagnosis.Results: Transurethral resection with bipolar electrocautery was carried out without difficulty or complication in all cases. Similarly, there were no complications in resection by standard monopolar electrocautery. The bladder tumor chips obtained with bipolar TURBT were smaller because of the smaller size of the bipolar loop. However, this did not interfere with the pathologic assessment. There were no significant pathologic differences between specimens according to the type of cautery used. A large degree of cautery artifact was noted in the tissue of larger tumors resected using both monopolar and bipolar electrocautery. However, the incidence and degree of cautery artifact were similar in the two groups. No trends between tumor location and degree of cautery effect were noted. The pathologist had no difficulty reaching a full and proper diagnosis in all cases involving either form of electrocautery.Conclusions: Bipolar electrocautery is well suited for TURBT.

No difference seen in thermal artifacts between PK & monopolar.","Background and Purpose: Recently, the electrovaporization (EV) technique has been used for loop endoresection of bladder tumors. Our objective was to evaluate whether bladder tumors resected by EV with a loop wire are fit for histologic diagnosis. In addition, a quantitative comparison was made with the thermal artifacts created with a standard electrocautery (EC) loop resection.Materials and Methods: In 26 patients with bladder tumors at various locations, endoresection was performed. In nonselective order, EV (N = 9; Gyrus® device) or EC (N = 17; Valleylab® device) was used. Histologic thermal artifacts were defined, and the diagnosis (pT classification) was determined. The linear depth of the thermal artifacts in the resected tissue was quantified with a computerized analysis system and statistically analyzed with the t-test.Results: One case was excluded because the tissue was not fit for morphometric measurements. In all cases, a histologic diagnosis could be made. No qualitative differences were found between the groups in the extent of histologic thermal artifacts. The mean depth of the thermal artifact zone was 0.237 mm (range 0.060–0.469 mm; SD 0.098 mm) in the EV group and 0.260 mm (range 0.080–0.410 mm; SD 0.112 mm) in the EC group. This difference is not significant (P = 0.8).Conclusion: In these series, EV with a loop wire seemed to be a valid method to preserve bladder tumor specimens for histologic diagnosis.

Effect on diagnosis similar to electrocautery.,"Introduction: Traditionally, transuretheral resection of bladder tumors(TURBT) is performed with high energy monopolar electrocautery whichoften causes cautery artifact in the specimen and resection bed. The GYRUSplasmakinetic resection system uses bipolar technology with saline irrigation.Resection technique is similar to standard TURBT but with improvedvisualization, excellent hemostasis, and less cautery artifact at the resectionbed.. We investigated whether the histologic diagnosis and specimen preservationwere impacted using the GYRUS system.Patients/ Methods: Thirteen patients with bladder tumors were treated withstandard TURBT (8) or GYRUS (5). Each histologic specimen was reviewedby a single pathologist, who was blinded to the treatment. The depth of thermalartifact, amount of thermal damage, preservation of specimen, and affecton diagnosis were assessed. Thermal artifact was measured in millimetersfrom the edge of the specimen until normal tissue was seen. Thermaldamage was graded as: 1 5 none; 2 5 ,25% of tissue damaged (minimal);3 5 25% to 80% of tissue damaged (moderate); 4 5 . 80% of the tissuedamaged (extensive). Specimen preservation was graded from 1 (poor) to 4(excellent). The effect of thermal artifact damage on making an accurate diagnosiswas graded from 1 (preventing diagnosis) to 4 (no affect).Results: The mean depth of thermal artifact for the TURBT group was2.2mm and for the GYRUS group 1.9mm. The mean grade for amount ofthermal artifact in the TURBT and GYRUS groups was 2.0 and 2.25 respectively.Tissue preservation for the TURBT group was 2.9 and for theGYRUS group 3.2. The effect on diagnosis in the TURBT group was 3.4and in the GYRUS group 3.8Conclusion: The GYRUS plasmakinetic resection system provides an attractivealternative to standard TURBT for the resection of bladder tumorswith good maintenance of tissue architecture. It provides specimens whichare equal to if not superior to the quality of resection with standard electrocautery.",http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/08927790152686875?journalCode=end,

Hospital stay 1.8 days, catherization 1.6 days","Introduction and Objective With the improvement ofmedical therapy and minimally invasive surgical treatmentsfor benign prostatic hypertrophy, the number oftransurethral resection of prostates (TURP) done duringurology training is decreasing. With fewer TURPS, proficiencyin this basic urologic technique has decreased,leading to longer resection times. Hence, the risk forfluid absorption, water toxicity, and potential electrolyteabnormalities (“TUR syndrome”) using hypotonic irrigantis also increased. We propose to demonstrate thesafety of bipolar electrocautery TURP with the Gyrus PKsystem using normal saline as irrigant.Methods Eighteen males, ages 54-85, underwent salineTURP from June 2002 to April 2003. Serum sodium,chloride, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels were drawnone hour prior to and following TURP. Resection time,tissue weights on pathologic examination, hospital stay,blood transfusions, and catheter time were recorded andanalyzed.Results Mean age was 69.6 years (range 54-85). Meanpre and post resection sodium levels were 138.9 and138.8 mEq/l (130-142 and 134-143). Mean pre andpost resection chloride levels were 106.5 and 108.9mEq/l (102-114 and 106-116). Mean pre and post resectionhemoglobin and hematocrit levels were 12.9 and39.3 g/dl (8.7-15.2 and 33.7-46.7), and 12.0 and 36.9g/dl (8.2-14.4 and 27.5-43.7), respectively. Mean resectiontime was 74.7 minutes (45-140). Mean tissueweight was 22.0 grams (5-56). Average hospital staywas 1.8 days and average catheter time was 1.6 days.There was no statistically significant difference betweenthe pre and post resection values for any parameter.One patient developed a postoperative urethral stricture,and one patient required repeat endoscopy for persistenthematuria.Conclusion Bipolar TURP using saline is a safe alternative,and is technically no different than traditionalmonopolar TURP.",http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/089277903769239090?prevSearch=allfield%253A%2528Gilleran%2BJP%2529&searchHistoryKey=,

International prostate symptom scores (I-PSS), uroflowmetry, measurement of residual urine amount and ultrasonography were performed for each patient both preoperatively and postoperatively (first month and first year). Operation times, urethral catheterization times, preoperative and postoperative Hb, Htc and serum Na values of the patients were compared and the complications of the groups were also compared.Results: On first month and first year follow up between the groups, there was no significant statistical difference in I-PSS, maximum flow rate, average flow, residual urine and size of the prostate. The decrease in serum Na level was found to be significantly higher in the TURP group (P < 0.05). The operation times were not significantly different between the groups. While the postoperative catheterization time was 75.7 h in TURP group, it was found to be 42 h in PKRP group and it was clear that catheterization time was significantly shorter (P < 0001).Conclusion: It is obvious that PKRP is as efficient as TURP and it has a similar morbidity.

Operative room charges were 7.2% less for PK TURP, despite larger size of gland, LOS .5 for PK vs 1.2 for MP","Purpose: Traditional treatment of BPH has been transurethral resection of theprostate (TURP) utilizing standard monopolar electrocautery. While this procedurehas been historically successful, the complications and inherent costs can besignificant. TUR with the Gyrus System using 90% normal saline is a new modalityto treat bladder outlet obstruction secondary to BPH. The system has beendesigned to work in a saline environment with the ability to resect and vaporizetissue simultaneously. The use of saline has the potential to limit TUR syndrome,minimize the limits of large prostate resections and effectively control hemostasis.We present a retrospective comparative analysis of the Gyrus procedure ascompare to the standard monopolar resection, from a financial perspective.Materials and Methods: Between 2000 and 2001, 22 patients were treated withthe Gyrus Saline TUR System of which 16 were available for long-term followup.All patients underwent AUA scores, TRUS for gland measurement and urodynamicevaluation. Patients were then followed with post-op AUA scores anduroflow evaluations. Detailed itemized charge data from individual patient chartstreated with Saline TURP were compared with similar data from patients whounderwent standard monopolar TURP. Charges were used for comparison as institutionalpolicy prohibits publication of actual dollar cost amounts. Yearly financialdata were adjusted for medical inflation by 4.6%, between 2001 and 2002data.Results: For Saline TURP the average operative time (minutes) was 56.0 616 compared to 76.1 6 23 for monopolar (p 5 0.044).

Smaller glands do not require Bladder Irrigation, means procedure can be done on a same day basis.","Authors from Detroit assess the use of the bipolar TURP against the monopolar technique; there were relatively few patients, reflecting the decreasing requirement for TURP in the USA. In addition, the amount of resected tissue was not particularly large, almost certainly a reflection of the decreasing size of resected prostatic tissue in that country. They found the bipolar TURP to have many advantages over standard monopolar TURP, and these are described.Acute urinary retention is a common urological emergency, and authors from London found that it had a measurable impact on the health-related quality of life of patients who develop this problem. They describe particularly how painful a condition it is, and that it had a significant economic burden.OBJECTIVETo assess bipolar transurethral prostatectomy (TURP) using the Gyrus system (Gyrus Medical, Maple Grove, MD) compared with a standard monopolar TURP.PATIENTS AND METHODSAll 43 patients undergoing TURP from November 2000 to August 2002 were reviewed retrospectively; the 1.5-year observation period allowed for the detection of late complications. In all, 18 consecutive patients had standard and 25 had bipolar TURP.RESULTSThe resection was 18 g for standard and 15 g for the Gyrus TURP (part of the Gyrus chips are vaporized during resection). The Foley catheter was removed sooner (1.8 vs 3.2 days) and the hospital stay was less in the Gyrus group (1.2 vs 2.1 days). Acute complications occurred in a third of the standard group and four (16%) of the Gyrus group. Long-term complications were comparable, at two each in the standard and Gyrus groups. Four patients (15%) with small glands went home on the day of surgery, needing no bladder irrigation after Gyrus TURP.CONCLUSIONFew innovations in TURP technique have been described in the past few decades but comparing Gyrus to standard TURP showed that the former allows earlier removal of the urinary catheter and earlier discharge from hospital, while decreasing complications. The Gyrus system also has other benefits; it allows coagulation of tissue during resection, resulting in excellent intraoperative visualization, and normal saline is used as the irrigant fluid, reducing the potential for TUR syndrome. The shorter stay after Gyrus TURP can result in cost savings of up to $1200/patient/day at our institution.",http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2005.05253.x/abstract,

In this study we assessed a possibleinfluence of dutasteride (types 1 and 2 isoenzymes of 5-alpha-reductase) on prostatetissue vascularity. We also try to evaluate whether preoperative treatment with dutasteridecould help to avoid excessive bleeding in patients undergoing TUR-P.Material & Methods: This pilot study has 2 phases. All patients enrolled in the study hadPSA < 4 ng/ml and normal DRE. In the first phase we included 32 patients. CDS wasperformed before and 6 weeks after treatment with 0.5 mg dutasteride/day. The entireprostate gland was examined employing a step-like technique with 0.5 cm for each step.Color preset was optimized to detect the lowest and slowest blood flow within the prostate.We counted every discrete color Doppler signal (CD-spot). To compare CDS data weused the Student’s t test and p< 0.05 was considered significant. Afterwards 43 patientsjoined the 2nd phase. Patients were assigned to the control and study groups accordingto sequentially numbered sealed envelopes. Patients in the were study group (n-22)received 0.5 mg dutasteride 6 weeks before TURP, while patients enrolled in the controlgroup (n- 21) had no pre-treatment.Results: 1st phase: Prostate volumes ranged from 35.7 to 53.9 ml. Mean CD-spots beforeand after the treatment were 11.6±6.38 and 8.22±5.24, respectively. Significant declinein CD-spots count was detected in 23 (72%) patients (p<0.05) and was more distinctivein the periurethral zone at the step-images proximal to verumontanum. 2nd phase: Therewas no significant difference in the mean age of two groups (p= 0.524). The same is trueabout mean volume of transition zone (p=0.482), mean weight of resected tissue (p=0.433) and mean Hb before TUR-P (p= 1.000). Operating time and volume of irrigationfluid were significantly different in control and study groups (50.55 min / 42.65, p= 0.014;13.10/8.03, p=0.047). Two patients in the control group received blood transfusion. Therewas no case of TUR syndrome in the study group, while it was documented in 2 patientsin the control group.Conclusions: Six weeks of dutasteride treatment may reduce prostate tissue vascularityin the periurthral area proximal to verumontanum, thereby pre-TURP treatment with thismedicine could be beneficial. 2nd phase of our study confirmed that pre-operative treatmentwith dutasteride could improve operative performance and avoid TUR syndrome.",http://www.europeanurology.com/article/S1569-9056(07)60053-0/pdf/54+VARDENAFIL+REDUCES+PROSTATE+HYPERPLASIA+AND+IMPROVES+LOWER+URINARY+TRACT+SYMPOTMS+IN+THE+RAT,

Diagnostic work-up and indications for TURP should follow the European Association of Urology benign prostatic hyperplasia guidelines. Pressure flow studies are not indicated as a routine diagnostic procedure but are highly recommended under certain conditions (eg, unsuccessful TURP, young age, previous pelvic surgery). Various technical improvements such as video-TURP, continuous-flow instruments, and bipolar TURP have substantially decreased the mortality and morbidity of TURP today. In the bipolar transurethral resection era, bleeding remains the most significant intra- and perioperative complication. The short-term and, particularly, long-term efficacy of TURP is unsurpassed, as documented by substantial improvements in symptoms, maximum flow rate, and postvoid residual volume. The retreatment rate of TURP is in the range of 8–12% within a decade after primary surgery, a value reached by many minimally invasive procedures as early as within 1–2 yr. Despite an intense 20 yr of research for a minimally invasive alternative, TURP still is and will most likely remain the reference standard for the surgical management of severe BPO.Take Home MessageDiagnostic work-up and indications for transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) should follow the European Association of Urology benign prostatic hyperplasia guidelines.

In group 1, TURPwas performed using the Gyrus® plasmakinetic systemwith axipolar electrocautery and sterile saline as theirrigation solution. Patients in group 2 underwent conventionalTUR-P with unipolar electrocautery and mannitolas the irrigation solution. The volumes of the adenomasranged between 45-100 gr. The resections wereperformed by the same surgeon and 26 fr resectoscopeswere used in both groups.Results The were no statistically significant differencesin age of the patients, preoperative prostate volumes,mean operation time, early postoperative uroflowmetryparameters, hospital stay and blood loss, between group1 and 2.

We evaluated the time to catheter removal and hospital discharge, operating time, blood loss, postoperative irrigation, complications, urinary flow rates, symptom relief, and postvoid residual volumes.ResultsAt baseline, the study groups were comparable in age, prostate volume, mean prostate-specific antigen value, International Prostate Symptom Score, quality-of-life score, flow rate, and postvoid residual volume. The mean catheterization time was 72 and 100 hours in the PK and standard groups, respectively. This difference was statistically significant (P <0.05), as was the difference in the time to hospital discharge.

With fewer TURPS, proficiencyin this basic urologic technique has decreased,leading to longer resection times. Hence, the risk forfluid absorption, water toxicity, and potential electrolyteabnormalities (“TUR syndrome”) using hypotonic irrigantis also increased. We propose to demonstrate thesafety of bipolar electrocautery TURP with the Gyrus PKsystem using normal saline as irrigant.Methods Eighteen males, ages 54-85, underwent salineTURP from June 2002 to April 2003. Serum sodium,chloride, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels were drawnone hour prior to and following TURP.

International prostate symptom scores (I-PSS), uroflowmetry, measurement of residual urine amount and ultrasonography were performed for each patient both preoperatively and postoperatively (first month and first year). Operation times, urethral catheterization times, preoperative and postoperative Hb, Htc and serum Na values of the patients were compared and the complications of the groups were also compared.Results: On first month and first year follow up between the groups, there was no significant statistical difference in I-PSS, maximum flow rate, average flow, residual urine and size of the prostate. The decrease in serum Na level was found to be significantly higher in the TURP group (P < 0.05). The operation times were not significantly different between the groups. While the postoperative catheterization time was 75.7 h in TURP group, it was found to be 42 h in PKRP group and it was clear that catheterization time was significantly shorter (P < 0001).Conclusion: It is obvious that PKRP is as efficient as TURP and it has a similar morbidity.

TUR with the Gyrus System using 90% normal saline is a new modalityto treat bladder outlet obstruction secondary to BPH. The system has beendesigned to work in a saline environment with the ability to resect and vaporizetissue simultaneously. The use of saline has the potential to limit TUR syndrome,minimize the limits of large prostate resections and effectively control hemostasis.We present a retrospective comparative analysis of the Gyrus procedure ascompare to the standard monopolar resection, from a financial perspective.Materials and Methods: Between 2000 and 2001, 22 patients were treated withthe Gyrus Saline TUR System of which 16 were available for long-term followup.All patients underwent AUA scores, TRUS for gland measurement and urodynamicevaluation. Patients were then followed with post-op AUA scores anduroflow evaluations.

With fewer TURPs being performed, proficiency in this basic urologic technique has decreased, causing longer resection times. This often leads to a higher risk of fluid absorption, water toxicity, and hyponatremia (TUR syndrome). We examined the safety of bipolar electrocautery TURP (saline TURP) with the Gyrus PlasmaKinetic system using normal saline as irrigant. Patients and Methods: Twenty-one men aged 54 to 85 years (median 70.0 years) underwent saline Plasma- Kinetic TURP from June 2002 to August 2003. Serum sodium, chloride, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were measured 1 hour prior to and 1 hour after TURP. Resection time, tissue weights, hospital stay, and catheter time were recorded and analyzed. Results: The median preresection and postresection sodium concentrations were 139.0 mEq/mL and 140.0 mEq/L, respectively (ranges 130–142 mEq/L and 134–143 mEq/L). The corresponding chloride values were 106.5 mEq/L and 109.0 mEq/L (ranges 102–114 mEq/L and 106–116 mEq/L), and the hemoglobin and hematocrit values were 13.4 g/dL and 40.1 g/dL (8.7–15.2 g/dL and 33.7–46.7 g/dL) and 12.0 g/dL and 36.6 g/dL (8.2–14.4 g/dL and 27.5–43.7 g/dL), respectively. The median resection time was 65 minutes (range 45–140 minutes), and the median resected tissue weight was 20 g (range 5–61 g). There was no statistically significant difference between the preresection and postresection sodium concentrations, and no patient exhibited any clinical sign of TUR syndrome. Conclusion: Gyrus PlasmaKinetic TURP using normal saline as the irrigant is a safe alternative to and is technically no different from traditional monopolar TURP.

Operative room charges were 7.2% less for PK TURP, despite larger size of gland, LOS .5 for PK vs 1.2 for MP","Purpose: Traditional treatment of BPH has been transurethral resection of theprostate (TURP) utilizing standard monopolar electrocautery. While this procedurehas been historically successful, the complications and inherent costs can besignificant. TUR with the Gyrus System using 90% normal saline is a new modalityto treat bladder outlet obstruction secondary to BPH. The system has beendesigned to work in a saline environment with the ability to resect and vaporizetissue simultaneously. The use of saline has the potential to limit TUR syndrome,minimize the limits of large prostate resections and effectively control hemostasis.We present a retrospective comparative analysis of the Gyrus procedure ascompare to the standard monopolar resection, from a financial perspective.Materials and Methods: Between 2000 and 2001, 22 patients were treated withthe Gyrus Saline TUR System of which 16 were available for long-term followup.All patients underwent AUA scores, TRUS for gland measurement and urodynamicevaluation. Patients were then followed with post-op AUA scores anduroflow evaluations. Detailed itemized charge data from individual patient chartstreated with Saline TURP were compared with similar data from patients whounderwent standard monopolar TURP. Charges were used for comparison as institutionalpolicy prohibits publication of actual dollar cost amounts. Yearly financialdata were adjusted for medical inflation by 4.6%, between 2001 and 2002data.Results: For Saline TURP the average operative time (minutes) was 56.0 616 compared to 76.1 6 23 for monopolar (p 5 0.044). Mean gland size (gm) was57.986 15.84 versus 43.336 17.14 for Saline TUR and monopolar respectively(p 5 0.052). Mean operative room charges were 7.2% less for Saline TURP (p 50.094) despite the significant difference in prostate size.

Maximum absorption by the breath-ethanol reading was compared with the serum concentration of absorbed glycine (analysed by anion-exchange chromatography).RESULTSComplete data on 120 men were assessed; 75% of the men absorbed irrigation fluid, with glycine levels above the normal range. The sodium levels tended to decrease with increasing glycine levels (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, __0.57; 120 men) and five men (4%) developed clinical features of the TUR syndrome. There was a weak correlation between breath-ethanol levels and serum glycine levels (Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, 0.54). The experience of the surgeon, the weight of the resected chips, and the operative duration were not significantly predictive of irrigation fluid absorption.CONCLUSIONSA rising breath-ethanol level indicates irrigation fluid absorption. However, irrigating fluid absorption is unpredictable, supporting the case for alternative, potentially safer irrigants.",http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2006.06208.x/abstract,

Data were collected regarding patient profile, prostate weight, operative time, and perioperative events. In particular, we studied and compared the preoperative and postoperative serum sodium concentrations and hematocrit.ResultsThe mean age was 68 years (range 57 to 76). The mean resection weight of the prostatic chips was 49.6 g (range 37 to 62). Senior urology residents under the supervision of the university faculty performed all procedures. The average operative time was 2 hours, 22 minutes (range 98 to 175 minutes). The mean serum sodium concentration decreased by 1.6 mg/dL (from 138.4 mg/dL preoperatively to 136.8 mg/dL postoperatively). The mean hematocrit decreased by 5.60% (from 40.24% preoperatively to 34.64% postoperatively). Postoperative recovery was uneventful in all 5 patients.ConclusionsBipolar saline TURP is safe and eliminates the risk of TURP syndrome in high-risk patients with large prostates that require lengthy resection.

In group 1, TURPwas performed using the Gyrus® plasmakinetic systemwith axipolar electrocautery and sterile saline as theirrigation solution. Patients in group 2 underwent conventionalTUR-P with unipolar electrocautery and mannitolas the irrigation solution. The volumes of the adenomasranged between 45-100 gr. The resections wereperformed by the same surgeon and 26 fr resectoscopeswere used in both groups.Results The were no statistically significant differencesin age of the patients, preoperative prostate volumes,mean operation time, early postoperative uroflowmetryparameters, hospital stay and blood loss, between group1 and 2. Mean weight of resected tissue in group 1 and2 were 50 and 44 grams respectively and the differencewas not significant. However there was a significantdecrease in serum Na and Cl concentrations of thepatients in group 2 when compared to group 1 (p<0,01).There were no postoperative complications in eithergroups.Conclusions TUR-P with saline irrigation & axipolar electrocauteryis an effective treatment in patients withlarger prostates, even in adenomas greater than 60grams. With this method it is possible resect greater volumesof tissue without interfering with the electrolytebalance of the patient.

Smaller glands do not require Bladder Irrigation, means procedure can be done on a same day basis.","Authors from Detroit assess the use of the bipolar TURP against the monopolar technique; there were relatively few patients, reflecting the decreasing requirement for TURP in the USA. In addition, the amount of resected tissue was not particularly large, almost certainly a reflection of the decreasing size of resected prostatic tissue in that country. They found the bipolar TURP to have many advantages over standard monopolar TURP, and these are described.Acute urinary retention is a common urological emergency, and authors from London found that it had a measurable impact on the health-related quality of life of patients who develop this problem. They describe particularly how painful a condition it is, and that it had a significant economic burden.OBJECTIVETo assess bipolar transurethral prostatectomy (TURP) using the Gyrus system (Gyrus Medical, Maple Grove, MD) compared with a standard monopolar TURP.PATIENTS AND METHODSAll 43 patients undergoing TURP from November 2000 to August 2002 were reviewed retrospectively; the 1.5-year observation period allowed for the detection of late complications. In all, 18 consecutive patients had standard and 25 had bipolar TURP.RESULTSThe resection was 18 g for standard and 15 g for the Gyrus TURP (part of the Gyrus chips are vaporized during resection). The Foley catheter was removed sooner (1.8 vs 3.2 days) and the hospital stay was less in the Gyrus group (1.2 vs 2.1 days). Acute complications occurred in a third of the standard group and four (16%) of the Gyrus group. Long-term complications were comparable, at two each in the standard and Gyrus groups. Four patients (15%) with small glands went home on the day of surgery, needing no bladder irrigation after Gyrus TURP.CONCLUSIONFew innovations in TURP technique have been described in the past few decades but comparing Gyrus to standard TURP showed that the former allows earlier removal of the urinary catheter and earlier discharge from hospital, while decreasing complications. The Gyrus system also has other benefits; it allows coagulation of tissue during resection, resulting in excellent intraoperative visualization, and normal saline is used as the irrigant fluid, reducing the potential for TUR syndrome. The shorter stay after Gyrus TURP can result in cost savings of up to $1200/patient/day at our institution.",http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1464-410X.2005.05253.x/abstract,

The patients in group 2 (n = 43; mean age: 65.4 ± 8.9 years) underwent bipolar TUVP. Cases in the two study groups matched for demographic characteristics and clinical parameters were assessed. The evaluation of IPSS scores, PVRU, Qmax, and prostatic volumes of the patients 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year postoperatively did not reveal any significant differences between the two groups. In group 2 (TUVP), postoperative catheter indwelling times were significantly shorter, and Na serum concentrations were also markedly lower (p < 0.005).","OBJECTIVES: A prospective randomized study was conducted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of bipolar plasma vaporization with a novel electrode that produces vaporization of the tissue (transurethral vaporization of the prostate, TUVP) immersed in isotonic saline compared to the standard transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Patients andMETHODS: From February 2009 to February 2010, 90 patients with BPH were randomized into two groups, and underwent conventional TURP (group 1) or TUVP (group 2) utilizing bipolar plasma vaporization with an innovative electrode (Olympus Winter & Ibe GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). International Prostate Symptom Scores (IPSS), transrectal ultrasonographic findings, maximal urine flow rates (Qmax), and postvoiding residual urine (PVRU) volumes of all cases were evaluated preoperatively and 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year postoperatively. Preoperative and postoperative serum hemoglobin, hematocrit and sodium concentrations of all patients were measured. All patients included in the study were monitored for 1 year.RESULTS: In patients in group 1 (n = 47; mean age: 64.7 ± 7.3 years) TURP was performed. The patients in group 2 (n = 43; mean age: 65.4 ± 8.9 years) underwent bipolar TUVP. Cases in the two study groups matched for demographic characteristics and clinical parameters were assessed.

Plasma Vaporization Therapy (TUVP),Electrolyte balance,Olympus,PlasmaButton™,Nuhoglu,Olympus,The role of bipolar transurethral vaporization in the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia.,"Urologia Internationalis, March 2011","In patients in group 1 (n = 47; mean age: 64.7 ± 7.3 years) TURP was performed. The patients in group 2 (n = 43; mean age: 65.4 ± 8.9 years) underwent bipolar TUVP. Cases in the two study groups matched for demographic characteristics and clinical parameters were assessed. The evaluation of IPSS scores, PVRU, Qmax, and prostatic volumes of the patients 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year postoperatively did not reveal any significant differences between the two groups. In group 2 (TUVP), postoperative catheter indwelling times were significantly shorter, and Na serum concentrations were also markedly lower (p < 0.005).","OBJECTIVES: A prospective randomized study was conducted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of bipolar plasma vaporization with a novel electrode that produces vaporization of the tissue (transurethral vaporization of the prostate, TUVP) immersed in isotonic saline compared to the standard transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Patients andMETHODS: From February 2009 to February 2010, 90 patients with BPH were randomized into two groups, and underwent conventional TURP (group 1) or TUVP (group 2) utilizing bipolar plasma vaporization with an innovative electrode (Olympus Winter & Ibe GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). International Prostate Symptom Scores (IPSS), transrectal ultrasonographic findings, maximal urine flow rates (Qmax), and postvoiding residual urine (PVRU) volumes of all cases were evaluated preoperatively and 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year postoperatively. Preoperative and postoperative serum hemoglobin, hematocrit and sodium concentrations of all patients were measured. All patients included in the study were monitored for 1 year.RESULTS: In patients in group 1 (n = 47; mean age: 64.7 ± 7.3 years) TURP was performed. The patients in group 2 (n = 43; mean age: 65.4 ± 8.9 years) underwent bipolar TUVP. Cases in the two study groups matched for demographic characteristics and clinical parameters were assessed. The evaluation of IPSS scores, PVRU, Qmax, and prostatic volumes of the patients 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year postoperatively did not reveal any significant differences between the two groups. In group 2 (TUVP), postoperative catheter indwelling times were significantly shorter, and Na serum concentrations were also markedly lower (p < 0.005).CONCLUSION: We detected similar effectiveness and morbidity rates in both groups. Bipolar TUVP has advantages such as shorter catheter indwelling times and hospital stays, and fewer bleeding episodes without any risk of transurethral resection syndrome. We believe that TUVP might be an alternative to TURP which is currently the 'gold standard' treatment in BPH.",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22086154,

Plasma Vaporization Therapy (TUVP),Volume Reduction,Olympus,PlasmaButton™,Kranzbuhler,Olympus,Tissue ablation after 120W greenlight laser vaporization and bipolar plasma vaporization of the prostate: a comparison using transrectal three-dimensional ultrasound volumetry ,"Photonic Therapeutics and Diagnostics VIII, 2012","Median pre-operative prostate volume was not significantly different between the two groups (45.3ml vs. 45.4ml; p=1.0). After catheter removal, median absolute volume reduction (BPV 12.4ml, LV 6.55ml) as well as relative volume reduction (27.8% vs. 16.4%) were significantly higher in the BPV group (p<0.001). After six weeks (42.9% vs. 33.3%) and six months (47.2% vs. 39.7%), relative volume reduction remained significantly higher in the BPV group (p<0.001).

It has been reported that bipolar plasma vaporization (BPV) of the prostate might be an alternative for LV. So far, it has not been shown that BPV is as effective as LV in terms of tissue ablation or hemostasis. We performed transrectal three-dimensional ultrasound investigations to compare the efficiency of tissue ablation between LV and BPV. Methods: Between 11.2009 and 5.2011, 50 patients underwent pure BPV in our institution. These patients were matched with regard to the pre-operative prostate volume to 50 LV patients from our existing 3D-volumetry-database. Transrectal 3D ultrasound and planimetric volumetry of the prostate were performed pre-operatively, after catheter removal, 6 weeks and 6 months. Results: Median pre-operative prostate volume was not significantly different between the two groups (45.3ml vs. 45.4ml; p=1.0). After catheter removal, median absolute volume reduction (BPV 12.4ml, LV 6.55ml) as well as relative volume reduction (27.8% vs. 16.4%) were significantly higher in the BPV group (p<0.001). After six weeks (42.9% vs. 33.3%) and six months (47.2% vs. 39.7%), relative volume reduction remained significantly higher in the BPV group (p<0.001). Absolute volume reduction was non-significantly higher in the BPV group after six weeks (18.4ml, 13.8ml; p=0.051) and six months (20.8ml, 18ml; p=0.3). Clinical outcome parameters improved significantly in both groups without relevant differences between the groups. Conclusions: Both vaporization techniques result in efficient tissue ablation with initial prostatic swelling. BPV seems to be superior due to a higher relative volume reduction. This difference had no clinical impact after a follow-up of 6M.",http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1310653,
